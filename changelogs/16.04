Known issues:

- The pre-installed webbrowser is unstable. To work around any problems you're experiencing, you can download the new experimental "WebBrowser Next" from the OpenStore. This issue will be targeted in OTA-5.
- Third-party apps that have binary components will have to be recompiled. This is due to an upstream ABI incompatibility between Qt 5.9 and earlier versions.
- Since we have to stick with the upstart init system for now, it is not yet possible to install snap packages. This will be targeted in a future release.
